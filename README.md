# GoSeek
Open Source Intelligence Tool

## Features
- Username Lookup - Inspired by [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock)
- IP Lookup - Uses [ip-api](https://ip-api.com/)
- Info Cull - Compile collected information

## Installation and Usage
Download via 'go get':
<code>go get -u github.com/audioo/goseek</code><br><br>
Run in terminal:
<code>goseek</code>

## Purpose
I have always found Open-Source Intelligence to be intriguing, and have found myself using Sherlock<br> on multiple occasions. I started learning Golang in the beginning of February of 2021 and have been looking <br>for new projects to help strengthen my knowledge. I also wanted these projects to keep me engaged<br> over time and prove somewhat useful instead of making just another calculator. I hope to build on GoSeek and expand it's use cases in a way that others can benefit.
