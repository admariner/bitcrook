    <h3>Creator</h3>
    <p>
        Hi there! My name is maraudery. I am a Computer Science student and Open-Source Intelligence enthusiast. I love creating software that can be of use to others<br>
        and learning new things! GoSeek Studio is still undergoing heavy development so expect bugs and errors. If you would like to make a contribution, please feel<br>
        free to open an issue or make a pull request to the Github repository. If you would like to make a monetary contribution, please see my <a href="https://github.com/maraudery">Github Profile README.</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Hosting</h3>
    <p>
        GoSeek Studio is currently being hosted on Heroku.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Collection and Tracking</h3>
    <p>
        I do not collect any data whatsoever. There are no trackers, no cookies being used, and no advertisements. GoSeek is also completely free to use, so no sign up and<br>
        no payment, completely eliminating the potential leak of confidential information. In order to keep GoSeek free and properly maintained, I would greatly appreciate some form of contribution.
